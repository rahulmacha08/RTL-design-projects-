the various projects which i do 
The first one is 
1. FIFO with verilog
 # 🚦 FIFO Buffer in Verilog with Testbench 🎯

A clean and modular implementation of a **First-In-First-Out (FIFO)** buffer in **Verilog**, designed for seamless data flow in digital systems. This repository includes both the design and a comprehensive **testbench** to validate functionality.

---

## 📌 Features

- ✅ Configurable **depth** and **data width**
- 🧠 Handles **full** and **empty** conditions gracefully
- 🔄 **Synchronous** design using clocked logic
- 🧪 Built-in **testbench** with self-checking capabilities
